# Collaboration Connection

This project is a very early stage app to connect musicians looking for collaborative partners in jobs or auditions. Currently the API is *very* loosely sketched out, there is basic authentication on the backend, and the frontend conditionally renders based on whether a user is logged in or not

Things I wanted to focus on
- Testing (Currently 93.09% coverage)
- GraphQL layer (using this project to learn graphQL)
- Authentication from scratch
-
